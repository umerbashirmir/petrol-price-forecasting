Purpose of the Wireframe:
This wireframe represents a simple visual frontend layout for a Petrol Price Prediction app (optional) that interacts with the backend Flask API.

While the current project uses a backend-only API, this wireframe shows how a user-friendly interface (e.g., using Streamlit or HTML) would look.
